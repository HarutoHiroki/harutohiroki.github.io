Welcome to my corner of the internet.

As this is the first time I'm writing a blog post, I thought it would be fitting to introduce myself and a few more things about this blog.

## Who Am I?

The name's HarutoHiroki. I'm a programmer and hardware tinkerer who's passionate about:

- **Virtual Reality** - The technology that allowed me to immerse myself in new worlds
- **Music** - I love music of all kinds, from classical to pop
- **Programming** - I love building things that (sometimes) work
- **Security & Privacy** - Because in this digital age, it's more important than ever

## What to Expect

On this blog, you'll find posts about:

- Project showcases and breakdowns (friends have been bugging me to do this for years)
- Tech opinions (probably some hot takes)
- Random thoughts and experiences

## The Tech Stack

This blog is built with my own BentoUI framework - pure vanilla JavaScript, no React, no Vue, no frameworks. Just good old HTML, CSS, and JS. 
Some call me a crazy demon for this, and they are correct.
The blog posts themselves are written in Markdown for easy writing and version control, and I also added some custom text styling features to make things more fun.

## Why Start a Blog in 2026?

In an age of social media and short-form content, why bother with a blog? Well, a few reasons:

This is my personal corner of the internet where I can express myself freely without algorithms dictating my reach. I wanted a space where I could write about things in depth, some thoughts requires more than 280 characters you see (cough Twitter cough). 
Not just that, it's a great way to document my journey and share knowledge with others; and I find that writing helps me learn and solidify my own understanding of topics.
My friends have also been encouraging me to start one for years, to leave a legacy of my work and thoughts (hopefully helping me land a job someday too LOL).

> "The best time to start a blog was 10 years ago. The second best time is now."

Stay tuned!
