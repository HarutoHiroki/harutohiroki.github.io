Welcome to my blog! 🎉

This is the first post on my new blog, and I'm excited to finally have a place to share my thoughts, projects, and random musings with the world.

## Who Am I?

I'm HarutoHiroki (or Phong, if you prefer my real name). I'm a programmer and hardware tinkerer who's passionate about:

- **Virtual Reality** - The technology that allowed me to immerse myself in new worlds
- **Music** - I love music of all kinds, from classical to pop
- **Programming** - I love building things that (sometimes) work
- **Security & Privacy** - Because in this digital age, it's more important than ever

## What to Expect

On this blog, you'll find posts about:

1. Programming tutorials and tips (haha maybe don't listen to me though)
2. Project showcases and breakdowns (friends have been bugging me to do this for years)
3. Tech opinions (probably some hot takes)
4. Random thoughts and experiences

## Why Start a Blog in 2026?

In an age of social media and short-form content, why bother with a blog? Well, a few reasons:

This is my personal corner of the internet where I can express myself freely without algorithms dictating my reach. I wanted a space where I could write about things in depth, some thoughts requires more than 280 characters you see (cough Twitter cough). 
Not just that, it's a great way to document my journey and share knowledge with others; and I find that writing helps me learn and solidify my own understanding of topics.
My friends have also been encouraging me to start one for years, to leave a legacy of my work and thoughts (hopefully helping me land a job someday too LOL).

> "The best time to start a blog was 10 years ago. The second best time is now."

## The Tech Stack

This blog is built with my own BentoUI framework - pure vanilla JavaScript, no React, no Vue, no frameworks. Just good old HTML, CSS, and JS. Some call me a crazy demon for this, but I believe in the power of simplicity and control. 
The blog posts themselves are written in Markdown for easy writing and version control, and I also added some custom text styling features to make things more fun.

## What's Next?

I've got a few posts in the pipeline:

- Why I chose vanilla JS over React
- Building a Bento-box UI from scratch
- My original journey into hardware tinkering

Stay tuned!
